# üèè  T20-Cricket IPL Analysis (2018‚Äì2024)

An interactive Streamlit-based data science project analyzing batter performance and dismissal patterns in the Indian Premier League (IPL) T20 competition from 2018 to 2024. Built by Sai Arun, Mustafa, and Mitali as a Data Science Lab project, it leverages detailed ball-by-ball data‚Äîincluding line, length, control, wagon wheel coordinates, dismissal types, and more‚Äîto provide actionable insights for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and teams.

# Features
Boundary Scoring Visualization:
General Wagon Wheel: Displays boundary shots (4s and 6s) with fixed lengths.
Intelligent Wagon Wheel: Adjusts shot length based on runs and shot difficulty.
Wagon Zone Wheel: Maps scoring zones (1-8) with strike rates, runs, and dismissal risks.
Shot Difficulty Analysis: Calculates and visualizes shot difficulty by line, length, and zone.


# Dismissal Trends:
Bar charts for outs by line and length.
Heatmap showing dismissal percentages across line-length combinations.
Bowling Style Breakdown: Compares batter performance against specific bowling styles (e.g., RFM, OB) with metrics like strike rate, boundary%, and impact per 100 balls.
Temporal Analysis: Tracks scoring patterns, strike rates, and dismissals over years.
Control vs. Non-Control Shots: Analyzes performance differences between controlled and uncontrolled shots.
Pressure Situations: Examines batter response after consecutive dot balls.
Bowler Type Matchup: Contrasts performance against spin vs. pace with zone-wise run distribution.
Strategic Insights: Each tab provides detailed takeaways for batters (e.g., areas to improve) and bowlers (e.g., zones to target).
